# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code

Day 0: January 2nd, 2019 

Today's Progress: Configured Anaconda with Python 3.6, started to watch Computational Linear Algebra lecture 1 from Fast.AI

Thoughts: I already had Anaconda installed with Python 3.6. something was broken when I tried to open the notebook, so I created a new environment.
